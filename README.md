## Purpose
Marketing departments do not have unlimited budgets to attract sales. Further, certain customers are more
likely to convert into a sale based on information that a business already possesses. The Recency, Frequency,
and Monetary Value model allows a business to target customers based on how recently a customer made
a purchase, how often they purchase, and how much they generally spend. However, can this approach be
used to predict repeated engagement with blood donation services?

The aim of this project is to produce a machine learning-based model to predict whether a blood donor
donated blood to the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsinchu, Taiwan in March 2007. Models were
characterized by comparing their predictions of donation status to true donation statuses contained in a
hold-out test set, and computing indicators of accuracy.
